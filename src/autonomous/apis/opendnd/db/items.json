The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet.

Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n#", "rarity": "legendary", "cost": null, "image": null, "description": "", "attunement": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type":

Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.

If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n#", "rarity": "legendary", "cost": null, "image": null, "description": "", "attunement": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type":

Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down.

Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n#", "rarity": "legendary", "cost": null, "image": null, "description": "", "attunement": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type":

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.

If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n#", "rarity": "legendary", "cost": null, "image": null, "description": "", "attunement": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type":

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 20\n\n**Hit Points:** 200\n\n**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n\n**Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down.

Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n#", "rarity": "legendary", "cost": null, "image": null, "description": "", "attunement": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type":

He hoped it would bring forth an immortal being that could surpass the limitations imposed by human flesh and surpass even the gods. Anuraag used the crucible to create so many monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the bottom of a mighty chasm. If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw against the crucible's powerful transmutation magic. If this saving throw fails, the creature's body liquefies and the creature is blinded, deafened, and paralyzed until the transformation is complete. The creature's equipment doesn't dissolve; as a result, most creatures are stripped naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into another creature. If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its original form by a <em>resurrection</em> spell or similar magic. If the process reaches completion, the creature transforms into another creature as if affected by a <em>shapechange</em> spell. The transformed creature must make a successful DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose its memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features, which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly born version of the creature it transformed into. Whether or not a creature retains its mental faculties, the newly assumed form is permanent. At that point, the creature can regain its former form (and memories and abilities) only through a <em>wish</em> spell. Constructs and undead are immune to the crucible's power, as is any creature that has the Shapechanger trait, such as a doppelganger.

Gax, later known to history as Gax the Great, was a mysterious figure renowned for his uncanny ability to weave together martial and magical combat in unique and powerful ways. An unparalleled master at crafting magic arms and armor, Gax is known for a number of fantastic, magical items. He is said to have created his first great item of magic when he was still a young apprentice. At that time, his master was an old wizard who mercilessly drilled the fundamentals of magic into the young apprentice's mind. The studious old wizard also derisively dismissed Gax's ideas for combining magic and battle and openly berated Gax for his love of swordplay, weaponry, and armor. Determined to prove that his theories were possible (and, truth be told, equally determined to spite his master), Gax apprenticed himself at the same time to a renowned weapon smith and armorer in a nearby town. The youth quickly proved as skilled at metalcraft as he was at magic. Young Gax spent his days in magical study and his nights working in the smith's forge, crafting an exquisite breastplate of the finest mithral. He imbued the breastplate's delicate glyphs and symbols with powerful protective magic far beyond the ability of magic-wielders many years his senior. When the breastplate was finally completed, Gax proudly showed it to his mentor. The smith was so impressed that he coveted it for himself, and he demanded that Gax give the breastplate to him. When Gax refused, the smith attempted to take it by force. At the end of a quick but violent scuffle, the smith lay dead near the very anvil on which Gax had finished his wondrous breastplate. Shocked and terrified, the boy fled, running to the small stone building where the old wizard lived. Hoping the wizard would be understanding about what happened and suitably impressed with Gax's magical breastplate, the boy breathlessly recounted recent events. The old wizard was neither understanding nor impressed. He coldly chided Gax for wasting his time on a \u201ctrinket\u201d and rebuked Gax for taking a life over \u201cnothing more than a worthless piece of pretty metal.\u201d Furious and defeated, Gax shouted profanities at his master before running off into the woods. Gax decided that he would make his way in the world on his own terms. He would learn everything he could about magic and combat, he would excel in both, and he would do whatever it took to fuse the two into what would eventually become known as the style of the battlecaster. From that day on, until the day he drew his final breath, Gax was never without his beloved <em>battlecaster's armor</em>.

The rite culminates in an ecstatic, mystical fervor and extreme loss of inhibition known as Shiv'ash (literally, \u201cthe madness and ecstasy of the moon\u201d). In this state, the lamia lose all self-control. They shout excitedly, shrieking out prophecies, and engage in all manner of debauchery. The Night of the Blood Moon occurs once per year. It is the most sacred of all Revelries\u2014a time when alliances are sealed, blood sacrifices are made, wars are ended, and new matriarchs are chosen. It is during a Night of the Blood Moon long ago that a powerful lamia cult created the <em>blood moon orb.</em> Little is known about the <em>blood moon orb</em>, save that it contains blood drops from the one hundred sacrifices made that night. It is said the lamia females wished to capture the mystical spirit of the moon itself in the <em>blood moon orb,</em> and some believe they did exactly that. While holding the orb, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

From soup to cheese, they told tales of a hero possessed of a \u201cFolding Door\u201d that fit in his pocket. When \u201cunfolded\u201d to full size it could be set anywhere (a stone wall, a tree, a waterfall) and opened to anywhere in the wide world, whisking the hero and her companions away from trouble in a trice. Too young to separate fact from fiction, yet old enough to recognize the prowess of their father, they asked me to craft them such a door. I explained that an object able to produce instant, multiple-location, inter-planar conjuration was impossible. To ease the sting of their disappointment, I explained that their story, while pure nonsense, was still interesting from an etymological standpoint. Centuries ago, a wizard named Foulton Konig was famed for creating magical doors. Sadly, specific details are lacking as his labs, libraries, and notes were lost when his mansion was destroyed in a catastrophically thorough, but historically non\u2011specific way. My children were fascinated to hear my theory that metaplasmic drift in the language (doubtless working in concert with poor education and rustic accents) eventually led a genuine product of magical artifice (a door made by Foulton) to eventually enter folklore as a \u201cFolding Door.\u201d This was my first brush with my eventual life's work and passion: my endless quest to separate the history of artifice from stories of the artificial. As such, I feel an odd gratitude toward their old governess, and occasionally feel a bit of remorse about ending her employment over the incident. Still, there are genuine wonders aplenty in the world without cluttering the minds of the young with nonsense. Mine is an endless struggle to separate fact from fancy, as shown by events of three months ago. Out conducting research, (while cunningly disguised to mix among the common folk) a seemingly reputable vendor of magical curiosities offered to sell me \u201ca fragment of a Foulton Door.\u201d (Note Fig 1. a splinter of wood, slightly longer than a handspan across.) Destroyed long ago, so powerful were the original doors that if even a small piece such as this were incorporated into an existing door, it would become imbued with the power of a magic portal. A quick check revealed the shard of wood <em>did</em>, in fact, possess a powerful, unfamiliar dweomer. With dubious curiosity, I bought it, returned to my lab, and followed their instructions. My tools and talents are not designed for anything so base as carpentry, but in the pursuit of truth I dutifully paid several hours of my precious time, a set of skinned knuckles, and one badly hammered thumb to patch the small piece of wood into one of the secondary pantry's doors. I then inserted the key to my winter lodgings, concentrated, and opened the door as the merchant had instructed me. Nothing happened, of course, and when I checked, the wood no longer showed any traces of magic. When I returned to the merchant to demand both an ethical and economic accounting, he had the audacity to imply it was my own fault, and refused to admit his obvious charlatanry or refund the twenty gold I had spent. While I regularly spend much greater sums in the course of my research, I nevertheless engaged the constabulary to bring the fellow into custody, as behavior such as this does nothing but defraud the simple-minded and tarnish the reputation of those engaging in legitimate arcane pursuits\u2026. Rumored to be pieces of destroyed magical doors, fragments of a <em>Foulton door</em> are varied in their shapes and sizes. Flinders of wood, bands of iron, screws, or even shards of broken glass are the most common, while intact and usable hinges, knobs, or entire planks of wood are rare. Although useless on their own, if you incorporate a fragment into an existing door, its magic allows that door to open to another location, even one on another plane of existence. The DC increases by 1 for each fragment added to a door beyond the first, but the DC can never be higher than 25. You can remove a fragment from a door by repeating the check, but removing a fragment doesn't result in a quirk. When a door has only one fragment, you can use an action to open the door to a door, doorway, or other similar entryway or egress of your choice within 100 miles of the door, and the travel is one\u2011way, meaning a creature that steps through the door can't step back through it. The door remains open for up to 1 minute. The door can't be used this way again until the next dawn. When a door has two or more fragments, it has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Opening the door expends 1 charge. A door with three or more fragments develops unique characteristics. Choose a characteristic when you incorporate the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th fragments. At the GM's discretion, you can choose an additional characteristic for every three fragments beyond the 12th. You can choose each characteristic only once, unless the characteristic's description says otherwise. The characteristics are presented in alphabetical order. If a characteristic requires a number of fragments, the door must have at least that number of fragments to gain that characteristic. If a characteristic requires you to incorporate a nonmagical object, such as a pane of glass or doorknob, into the door, you must incorporate that item before you can use that characteristic. Incorporating a nonmagical object into the door doesn't result in a quirk, but failure means you didn't incorporate the object and must repeat the check to incorporate it. You can choose this characteristic more than once, increasing the number of locations to which the door can be bound. Each time you select it, you must incorporate a new object that can be turned into the door and that object must be one of the targets of the magical bond. If you previously incorporated an object with multiple sides, like a hanging lantern or a wheel with spokes, you can make a different side of that object the target of the magical bond instead of incorporating a new object. title: How many fragments for a full door?\nSince the fragment sizes are so variable, the number of fragments required to \u201ccomplete\u201d a <em>Foulton door</em> is at the GM's discretion. Most adventurers go their entire lifetimes without ever constructing more than half a <em>Foulton door</em>, and there is no reason the players or GM should feel obligated to create a full door out of the fragments. Some groups might never have more than three fragments while others might have twenty. As the GM, choose whatever number or style best fits your group and the story you all want to tell. The variability of the characteristics, fragment powers, and quirks leave you and your group plenty of room to make the door as complex, unique, and fragmented as you need it to be. Each fragment you incorporate into a door increases the door's power. When you incorporate a fragment into the door, roll a d100 and consult the Fragment Powers table. Alternatively, your GM might choose a specific power for the fragment you incorporate, such as an iron band fragment that increases the door's damage threshold or an old, battered doorknob that leads to a particular plane of the Hells. Roll: [[Foulton Door#^powers]] | dice: 1d% | Power |\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1-20 | The distance the destination can be from the door's current location increases by 100 miles. |\n| 21-40 | The door's hit points increase by 10. |\n| 41-55 | The door can remain open for 1 additional minute. |\n| 56-70 | The door's damage threshold increases by 2. |\n| 71-80 | The door's maximum number of charges increases by 1. The door regains a number of expended charges daily at dawn equal to the nearest die type, rounded down ( 1d4 for 5 charges, 1d6 for 6 charges, etc.). |\n| 81-90 | The door's Armor Class increases by 1. |\n| 91-95 | The door has immunity to one additional type of damage (GM's choice). |\n| 96-100 | The door can travel to one additional plane (GM's choice). | When you incorporate a fragment into a door, you must make an appropriate tool check, as detailed in the <em>Foulton door</em> entry. When you succeed or fail by 5 or more, the door gains a quirk. Here we present tables of the types of quirks the door can acquire. Lesser quirks happen if the check succeeds (positive) or fails (negative) by 5\u20139. Greater quirks happen if the check succeeds (positive) or fails (negative) by 10 or more. When the door develops a quirk, consult the appropriate Quirks table, rolling the indicated die. Alternatively, your GM might choose a quirk that best fits the group or the situation of the success or failure. At the GM's discretion, if the door has a quirk you want to remove, spells such as <em>fabricate</em>, <em>greater restoration</em>, or <em>remove curse</em> might remove one or all of a door's quirks. Alternatively, the GM might require you to complete a specific task related to the quirk before removing it. (For ability checks that fail by 5-9) | d8 | Quirk |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | Each creature that steps through the door exits the other side soaking wet as if it just stepped out of a lake. |\n| 2 | The first time a creature steps through the door each day, it decreases in size by 10 percent. This effect lasts until the creature is targeted by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic. |\n| 3 | If a dangerous creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower is within 100 feet of the destination, the door magically attracts the creature to come to the door. |\n| 4 | Travel through the door is no longer instantaneous. Each creature that steps through the door arrives at the destination 10 minutes after it stepped through the door at the origin. |\n| 5 | Stepping through the door causes vertigo and mild nausea. Each creature that steps through the door is poisoned for 1 minute. |\n| 6 | The door makes noise, such as creaky hinges, a dinging bell, a trumpet blast, or similar loud sound, when it is opened, which is audible within 100 feet of the door at the origin and destination locations. |\n| 7 | The door dampens sound for travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is deafened for 10 minutes. |\n| 8 | The door brings misfortune on travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is affected by the <em>bane</em> spell for 1 hour. | (For ability checks that succeed by 5-9) | d8 | Quirk |\n| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | When you open the door, there is a 25 percent chance ( 1d%: &lt;= 25) the door doesn't expend a charge. |\n| 2 | Each time a creature steps through the door, it exits the other side clean, with freshly mended and laundered clothes, neatly trimmed hair, or similar signs of cleanliness. |\n| 3 | If a dangerous creature with an Intelligence of 4 or lower is within 100 feet of the destination, the door magically repulses the creature, discouraging it from coming within 100 feet of the door. |\n| 4 | Each creature that steps through the door can't be frightened for 1 hour. |\n| 5 | Stepping through the door invigorates travelers. Each creature that steps through the door has advantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute. |\n| 6 | Each creature that steps through the door becomes aesthetically pleasing to other creatures and has advantage on Charisma checks to interact socially with other creatures for 10 minutes. |\n| 7 | The door becomes more accepting of new fragments. Any creature incorporating a fragment has advantage on the check. |\n| 8 | The door brings fortune on travelers. Each creature that steps through the door is affected by the <em>bless</em> spell for 1 hour. | (For ability checks that fail by 10+) | d6 | Quirk |\n| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | The door always arrives at a dangerous location within 1 mile of the desired destination, unless the desired destination is already dangerous. |\n| 2 | Once opened, the door must remain open for its full duration. |\n| 3 | Travel through the door is no longer instantaneous. Each creature that steps through the door arrives at the destination 1 hour after it stepped through the door at the origin. This quirk replaces the lesser negative quirk that also makes the door's travel no longer instantaneous, if the door has that quirk. |\n| 4 | Each creature that steps through the door must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of fragments in the door). On a failure, a creature arrives at the destination but is incapacitated for 1 minute. |\n| 5 | When the door closes, it can't be reopened for 1 hour. |\n| 6 | When you open the door, it expends 2 charges instead of 1. | (For ability checks that succeed by 10+) | d6 | Quirk |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1 | When you open the door, there is a 50 percent chance the door doesn't expend a charge. This quirk replaces the lesser positive quirk that also gives the door a chance to not expend a charge, if the door has that quirk. |\n| 2 | If the destination location is dangerous, the door grows warm to the touch and is \u201cstuck\u201d for a moment when you try to open it, requiring you to pull or push a second time to open the door fully. |\n| 3 | You no longer need a key to open the door. You must still use an action and expend a charge (or charges if the door has that quirk) to open the door. In addition, if the door has the Foulton's Key characteristic, the maximum number of Foulton Keys you can tie to the door increases to 4. |\n| 4 | The door becomes more accepting of new fragments. The DC to incorporate a fragment reduces by 5. |\n| 5 | The Fragment Power of the fragment you incorporated into the door when you received this quirk becomes more potent. The fragment's numerical power is doubled. For example, if the fragment's power increases the distance the door can travel by 100 miles, it increases that distance by 200 miles instead. |\n| 6 | Each creature that steps through the door regains 2d6 hit points. When a creature regains hit points in this way, it can't regain hit points by stepping through the door again until it finishes a short or long rest. |</p>", "rarity": "fabled ", "cost": null, "image": {"url": null, "asset_id": 0, "raw": null}, "description": "", "attunement": "", "damage_dice": null, "damage_type": null, "weight": null, "ac_string": null, "strength_requirement": null, "properties": null, "slug": "foulton-door"}, "1099": {"pk": 1099, "name": "Fountmail", "desc": "<p>This armor is a dazzling white suit of chain mail with an alabaster-colored steel collar that covers part of the face.

Gax always told his friend that true strength comes from within, but Riggs continued to lament his physical weakness and size.

The people there welcomed the strangers, who happily remained in the village for many weeks. Then, the giants attacked. Gax and Riggs battled the giants and did everything they could to defend the village. Riggs used the power of his gauntlets to great effect, but in the end, he found it was his bravery and willingness to give his life to protect the villagers that truly won the day.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. However, you take 2d6 psychic damage whenever you fail a Wisdom saving throw. |\n| 31\u201340 | Your eyes develop to accommodate the dark, and you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. However, you take a \u22124 penalty on Dexterity saving throws. |\n| 41\u201350 | Claws burst from the ends of your fingers. Your claws are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your claw, it deals slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. However, your clawed hands make your normal actions more challenging, and you take a \u22124 penalty on attack rolls with weapons other than your claws. |\n| 51\u201360 | Your jaw extends, and your teeth grow constantly and haphazardly, only to fall out as new ones take their place. You are proficient with this bite, which deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier piercing damage on a hit. When you make a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to attack that same target with your bite. However, you can no longer verbally communicate, and you can't cast spells with verbal components. |\n| 61\u201370 | Your arms, shoulders, legs, and back bulge slightly as muscle and sinew double in mass.

However, the thickened blood also hinders your body's natural defenses, and you take a \u22124 penalty on Constitution saving throws. |\n| 91\u201300 | You develop an eye-watering reek. When a humanoid or beast starts its turn in a space within 5 feet of you, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving saving throw or use its reaction to move 5 feet away from you.

The arm can't wield weapons or hold items heavier than 5 pounds, but it can provide you some aid, granting you advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. However, the new limb throws off your coordination and sense of balance, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws you make. |\n| 31\u201340 | You start hemorrhaging excessively when hit, spraying magic-infused blood around you. When a creature hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage. However, any damage you take is increased by 1 as your blood flows more freely. |\n| 41\u201350 | Subtle changes in your scent and presence attracts humanoids and irritates beasts around you. When interacting socially with humanoids, you have advantage on Charisma checks. However, beasts with an Intelligence of 4 or lower are immediately hostile toward you. |\n| 51\u201360 | You grow a second, vestigial head. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, harmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious, and you can't be surprised while conscious. However, the mental input from the secondary head distracts you as it attempts to aid your attack rolls. Whenever you miss an attack roll, you take half the damage you would have dealt to the target. |\n| 61\u201370 | Your nerves become hyperactive, leading you to jerk, fidget, and move randomly and involuntarily. You gain a +2 bonus to AC as your enemies have a hard time determining your exact location. However, the involuntary movement makes it difficult for you to move and act deliberately. On your turn, you can use either an action or bonus action, not both. |\n| 71\u201380 | Your body twists, elongates, and forms extra skin or callouses as it adapts itself to a different mode of travel. You gain a burrowing or swimming speed (GM's choice) equal to your base walking speed. However, you speed is halved while walking on land. |\n| 81\u201390 | Your blood becomes toxic, and you become poisoned. However, while poisoned in this way, you are immune to disease, poison damage, and necrotic damage. |\n| 91\u201300 | Your metabolism slows imperceptibly, causing you to continue regenerating, albeit slowly.

At last, Althaghast knew he had to restore the balance. He carved a gleaming skull from solid alabaster, and for many weeks worked his most powerful magic upon it. The white necromancer used his strange skull to great effect, rooting out nests of vampires, eventually dragging the screaming vampire lord into the purifying light of the sun. He defeated a powerful spectre haunting a lonely road, and he even put a terrible lich to rest. When the balance between life, death, and unlife had at last been restored, Althaghast returned to the solitude of his tower. One evening, just after sunset, a beautiful woman came to speak with him. She asked about his magical alabaster skull, which he admitted was secured elsewhere in the tower. It was then that he noticed, for the first time, her deathly pale complexion. And her fangs.

When it was over, Jhana stood amid the sea of bodies and listened to the cries of the wounded. The magnitude of death was overwhelming. Bloodied and exhausted, Jhana moved among the bodies, healing every soul she could. As she went about her divinely appointed task, the hand upon her amulet glowed brightly. Jhana could feel her deity within her as the healing magic flowed through her hands. From that day forward, Jhana dedicated herself entirely to her deity. Although she continued to carry weapons, she used them only as a last resort. She spent the remainder of her days helping others and spreading messages of life and healing.

Ventu was a follower of a fringe religious order which believed all the world's ills stemmed from magic not granted by a deity. The order claimed that wizards, sorcerers, and their ilk were to blame for all the evil in the land as that magic was tainted by human hands rather than gifted by divine ones. Lord Ventu held tremendous sway in the kingdom, and he brought that considerable power to bear on his self-appointed mission of wiping out every last practitioner of magic in the land who wielded magic without the blessing of a deity. Thus began the <em>Purge Arcana</em>. To carry out the <em>Purge Arcana</em>, Ventu needed loyal warriors who could seek out and destroy practitioners of the arcane arts. To this end, he assembled a squad of like-minded zealots, and he outfitted them with breastplates enchanted by priests of his deity to neutralize magic and aid in killing those that wielded it. For years, Ventu's Mage Hunters scoured his kingdom, killing anyone who dared to practice magic. It was a dark and dangerous time, filled with fear and paranoia. Over time, Ventu grew increasingly paranoid, and his actions became more and more bizarre. Eventually, he decided that even his own Mage Hunters had become tainted by prolonged contact with the very magic that they were tasked to destroy. He summoned his most loyal soldiers and ordered them to round up and murder the Mage Hunters. For the Mage Hunters, it was the final straw. Many fled the kingdom in fear, but a few banded together and stormed Ventu's fortress. They killed the mad zealot then looked on his lifeless body in shocked disbelief. The Mage Hunters were appalled at what they had done, but they were even more appalled at what had transpired in the kingdom. It was as if Ventu had woven a spell on everyone and, now that he was dead, the spell was broken. The Mage Hunters disbanded.

Ruatha rushed through the forest, shouting for the animals to run toward the safety of the stream. Ruatha could hear the deep, rumbling voice of Oak Heart in the distance, rousing the trees of the forest. Through the confusion and smoke, panicked forest animals ran from the flames, and trees lumbered past Ruatha. After what seemed a lifetime, the singed and soot-covered druid finally dropped to his knees on the far side of the stream. Glancing around quickly, the exhausted druid was relieved to see that most of the forest animals had made it to safety, as had many of the trees. They were already re-rooting themselves into the ground and becoming still again. Coughing uncontrollably, the exhausted young druid collapsed on the ground. Ruatha's eyes flickered open. It was dawn and the storm was over. On the far side of the stream, Ruatha could see the devastation left behind by the forest fire. As far as the eye could see, the ground was black and burned. Ruatha noticed a large, still shape in the distance, near a group of smoldering tree trunks. His heart sank\u2014it was Oak Heart. The druid transformed into a hawk and soared to his friend. Oak Heart was dead, his bark blackened and charred. The ancient treant had died trying to save every last tree he could.

Justicars are arbiters of law and order, operating independently of any official city guard or watch divisions.

These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title.

Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings. Each by itself is a useful item, but they are made stronger when worn together.

Owain went to great lengths to ensure the safety, prosperity, and well-being of his people. He believed all people, regardless of their station in life, deserved to be treated fairly and equally. He codified the realm's first set of laws, and he even specified that no one, not even a king, was above the law. The reign of King Owain the Lion was truly a golden age. On the anniversary of Owain's 30th year on the throne, his lords commissioned a magnificent golden scepter to commemorate the king's long and just reign. Royal wizards and high clerics of the realm bestowed powerful protective magic upon the scepter, which was then presented to the appreciative king. By the time King Owain had reached his seventieth year, he was in failing health. The King transferred power to his young son, Prince Tarrgrin, during a solemn ceremony in which he formally turned over his <em>sovereign's scepter</em> to the young prince. Less than a year later, the great king, the Protector of the Realm, died peacefully in his sleep. The people had hoped that Owain's son would be as wise, strong, and just as his father had been. Alas, it was not to be. Although Tarrgrin tried to live up to his father's example, he was in truth but a shadow of the ruler King Owain had been. Within a few years, most of the lords were in open rebellion. Bitter, furious, and increasingly paranoid, Tarrgrin rejected his father's laws and swiftly imprisoned anyone suspected of treason. The kingdom was soon ripped apart by a bloody civil war. Eventually, the capital city was taken. King Tarrgrin was captured and beheaded, and in the chaos that followed, the <em>sovereign's scepter</em> disappeared. Perhaps it was taken by one of the lords; perhaps it was accidentally destroyed. There are many that believe someone loyal to King Owain's memory took the scepter and hid it away. Rumors say that, when someone truly worthy of Owain's ideals comes forward, the <em>sovereign's scepter</em> will be found once again.

Osland had already killed two dragons in his lifetime and was determined to make Vrithmytrix his third. Shouting a challenge of honor, the knight attacked! After the titanic battle, Vrithmytrix, the mighty black dragon, was dead. Osland hauled the black dragon's body back to his keep. There, he commissioned the creation of a wonderous suit of armor made from Vrithmytrix's scales and hide. He christened the armor <em>Vrithmytrix's Bane</em><strong>.</strong> Over time, Osland discovered that many of the black dragon's unique qualities had somehow carried over to the armor itself! One dark night almost a year later, Osland felt his entire keep shake. Rushing outside, he saw a large portion of the outer wall had been reduced to rubble, and a massive black dragon was circling overhead. As the terrible beast soared closer, its reptilian eyes widened at the sight of Osland's armor, then quickly narrowed in abject hatred. This was Vrithmytrix's mate, and it was much larger and more powerful than Vrithmytrix had been. Roaring in anger, the dragon swooped down, snatched Osland in its great claws and carried him away into the night sky. Osland was never seen again.

Two packs, each aggressive and dangerous, fought violently for dominance within a large forest, but neither could gain the upper hand. Both sides eventually suffered such losses that the two clans soon found themselves at the mercy of human hunters intent on killing them all. To ensure their survival, the werewolf leaders reluctantly agreed to bury their hatred for one another and the two diminished packs became one. To seal the alliance, each werewolf bestowed a gift upon the other. One pack leader gave the other a magical ring he named <em>wolf 's howl</em>. In return, the first pack leader was given a magical horn. For a time, the joined pack existed peacefully, and their combined might allowed them to rule the forest once again. However, the werewolf who possessed the magical horn grew disenchanted. He felt that his gift, the <em>wolf 's howl ring</em>, was far greater than the horn he had been given. He believed that the other werewolf pack leader had intentionally given him an inferior gift in order to slight him. Tensions grew between the two werewolves. When the inevitable breaking point came, the ensuing battle involved not only the leaders, but the entire pack. When the bloodbath was over, few of the werewolves remained alive. The victorious werewolf leader bathed his <em>wolf 's howl ring</em> in the blood of his enemy, and the ring absorbed the creature's dying essence into itself. The triumph was short-lived, however. The few survivors of the battle, including the werewolf leader, fell to the silvered arrows of hunters only a few days later.
