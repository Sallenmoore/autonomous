Alright, let's workshop this. Here's a little something for the set.

*(Leans into the mic, friendly and conspiratorial)*

You know, debugging code is a weirdly emotional rollercoaster. It's the only job where you go through the five stages of grief several times a day.

First, there's **Denial**: "No, that's impossible. My code is perfect. The *computer* must be wrong."

Then, **Anger**: "WHY WON'T YOU WORK?! I GAVE YOU LIFE! I CAN TAKE IT AWAY!" *(mimes shaking a monitor)*

Then, **Bargaining**: "Okay, look. If you just work for this one demo, I swear I'll go back and write the documentation. I'll even add comments. *Good* comments."

Followed by **Depression**: "I'm a fraud. I've forgotten how to type. Maybe I should have been a baker."

And finally, you reach **Acceptance**. Which, for a programmer, is when you finally accept that you have no idea why it's not working... and you just copy and paste a solution from a twelve-year-old Stack Overflow post written by someone named `CodeWizard420`.

And it works. And you have learned nothing. It's a beautiful cycle.
