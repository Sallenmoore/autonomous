Alright, let's get this script polished. Here's a little something for the open mic night down at the "Code & Dagger."

*(Leans into the mic, friendly and conspiratorial)*

You know, I was trying to explain Python to my friend the other day. He's not a tech guy. His idea of a "bug" is something you call an exterminator for.

So I'm telling him, "The whole philosophy of Python is that it's simple. It's beautiful. It's supposed to read like plain English."

And he's like, "Okay, show me."

So I pull up my laptop, and I show him a classic "Hello, World!"

`print("Hello, World!")`

He looks at it, squints, and says, "What's with the snakes?"

I go, "What snakes? There are no snakes."

He points at the screen. "Right there! The parentheses! They're two snakes that just ate something! Is that the 'Python' part? Is the code being digested?!"

...And you know what? I couldn't even be mad. Because now, every time I see a function call, I just think, "Ah, yes. A well-fed snake."

`list.append()`? That's a snake who just had a little snack.

`len()`? A snake who swallowed a measuring tape.

My entire career is just feeding snakes. And I'm okay with that. It's better than Java, where you have to build a cage for the snake, write a blueprint for the snake, and then file three forms of paperwork before you're allowed to feed the snake. I'll stick with my anacondas, thank you very much.
