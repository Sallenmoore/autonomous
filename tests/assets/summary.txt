At the remarkably specific, yet utterly meaningless, time of seven minutes past midnight, a dog was discovered. It lay impaled by a garden fork, a mundane tool serving a shockingly definitive purpose. The animal's posture, a twisted echo of chasing phantom cats in a dream, was in stark contrast to its undeniable, brutal end.

The observer, with a peculiar and detached logic, noted the fork's stability in the ground â€“ a trivial structural detail amidst the horror. They then, with a strangely clinical certainty, concluded the fork was the murder weapon, finding it absurd that one would impale a dog already dead from something as pedestrian as cancer or a traffic accident. Yet, after all this elaborate, yet ultimately inconsequential, deduction, certainty remained elusive. A perfectly pointless tableau of life's abrupt and absurd cessation.
