At the absurdly precise time of seven minutes past midnight, a dog was discovered, meticulously deceased. Its lifeless form eerily mimicked the joyful, frantic chase of a dream, a pathetic echo of vitality instantly negated by the garden fork impaled through its body â€“ a monument to mundane violence. The observer, with a chillingly detached logic, deduced this common implement was the murder weapon, rather than a whimsical post-mortem addition to a dog that, say, simply succumbed to the utter banality of cancer. Yet, even with such meticulous, yet ultimately futile, observation, definitive certainty remained hilariously out of reach. What a pointless spectacle.
